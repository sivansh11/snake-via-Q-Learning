-Use human_player.py for playing snake game by yourself, the controls are a bit non intuative as in insted of absolute directions (up down etc) the directions are relative 
to the direction the player is currently moving in (Easy to understand).

-You wont be able to use the run.py file if you dont have q.p file.

-Incase you dont have q.p file you can use train.py to train the q learning model for n episodes (recommended 10,000 episodes for good learning) and then you may run run.py.
